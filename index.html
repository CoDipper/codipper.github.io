<h1>OPTIONS</h1>
<p class="subtext">
  --php-developer
</p>
<p class="doublesubtext">
  Working with php development, I have experience with Codeigniter and SlimFramework, but I fall in love with Laravel recently and
  ever since I am shifting my skills around it. I am always open to learn new technologies, and I'm used to be involved in
  the full software life cycle, from conception and design to infrastructure, implementation and unit tests.
</p>
<p class="doublesubtext">
  General Knowledge:
</p>
<ul class="triplesubtext">
  <li>* HTML, Javascript, CSS, Bootstrap.</li>
  <li>* Programming languages: PHP & C++;</li>
  <li>* Test Driven Development (TDD);</li>
  <li>* Version Control (GIT, Git Bash);</li>
  <li>* jQuery, jChart & jTable;</li>
  <li>* MariaDB;</li>
</ul>

<p class="subtext">
  --slim-framework
</p>
<p class="doublesubtext">
  Half of my professional backend experience is around a customized version of SlimFramework.
  Developing and maintaining a trio of APIs build in Domain-Driven Design architecture.
  For the complexity of the business logic it is used a CommandHandler pattern where
  each API uses the same Domain models. -> almost like microservices tho they share a database as well.
</p>

<p class="subtext">
  --codeigniter
</p>
<p class="doublesubtext">
  My past professional experience is in Codeigniter 3.
  In my personal opinion, working with a standard MVC as well as jQuery, jChart & jTable
  was an incredible web developer starter pack.
  Full-stacking gives you clarity for each piece of the puzzle.
  PHP basic functions. Sessions. Databases. Rendering. Synchronous functions. XMLs. JSONs.
